# Idea for codefundo++
## Team PoliteSociety

During natural disasters, mobile network connectivity can be down, which makes communications difficult. Our idea attempts to provide basic connectivity to users using wireless mesh networking using bluetooth or wifi.
We intend to build an app to provide these services.

### Functionality:
- The app allows users to be volunteers or victims.
- It will connect to or create a mesh network.
- The app will share location coordinates of users allowing victims to locate volunteers.
- The app will provide basic navigation (whether or not map data is available) using coordinates and compass.
- Volunteers can share supplies they have to the app as well as be verified professionals (if they are).
- If internet connectivity is available, data (volunteer and victim location) will be uploaded to a common server. This data can be shared with authorities for disaster management.
- The app can also get data from the server such as alerts from authorities, suggested precautions, etc.
- Users can also communicate using a messaging service in the app.

### Access:
- The application can be dowloaded from the app store.
- This functionality can also be included in default messaging apps installed on devices. 

### Technologies:
Android SDK, Wireless Mesh networking, Azure Servers
